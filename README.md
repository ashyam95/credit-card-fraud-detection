# Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Problem Statement
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. For many banks, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal for different banks. In terms of substantial financial losses, trust and credibility, this is a concerning issue to both banks and customers alike.

In the banking industry, credit card fraud detection using machine learning is not just a trend but a necessity for them to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning is helping these institutions to reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denials of legitimate transactions.

## Understanding Fraud
Credit card fraud is any dishonest act and behaviour to obtain information without the proper authorization from the account holder for financial gain. Among different ways of frauds, Skimming is the most common one, which is the way of duplicating of information located on the magnetic strip of the card.  Apart from this, the other ways are:

- Manipulation/alteration of genuine cards
- Creation of counterfeit cards
- Stolen/lost credit cards
- Fraudulent telemarketing

## Data
The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, original features and more background information about the data is not avaialable. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
